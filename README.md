# Antigrav Portfolio Grapher

Antigrav Portfolio Grapher is a web application designed to visualize the financial performance of multi-ETF portfolios. It enables users to backtest investment strategies with historical data, making it easier to assess and compare portfolio performance over time.

## Features
- **Portfolio Visualization**: Aggregate and plot adjusted closing prices for multiple ETFs.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Calculate gains/losses dynamically and synchronize multi-ETF time-series data for accurate comparisons.
- **Backtesting Support**: Explore and evaluate historical data to backtest investment strategies.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Handling**: Algorithms for data aggregation, plotting, and dynamic synchronization.

## How It Works
1. Users input their portfolio details (selected ETFs and time range).
2. Backend algorithms fetch and process historical data to compute adjusted closing prices and portfolio performance.
3. The application plots time-series charts for an intuitive comparison of ETF performance.

## Collaboration
This project was developed during a hackathon in collaboration with two team members:
- **Frontend Development**: Integrated interactive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for a seamless user experience.
- **Backend Development**: Built Flask-based server to handle requests and process financial data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `flask`
